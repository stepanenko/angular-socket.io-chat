Linux powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It's the base which
everything is built upon. Android is based on Linux (its modified version).

Linux offers **the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer** (unlike Microsoft or Apple).
There's no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux.

There's not just "one Linux", instead, we have distributions.
For example **Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu** are probably the most popular.

Under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System, and it shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses (free alternative to UNIX).

UNIX is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70's.

The majority of the time you will run a Linux in the cloud via a **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** like DigitalOcean or AWS.

A **shell** is a command interpreter that exposes to the user an interface to work with the underlying operating system.
Shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a UI could ever possibly let you do.
Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.

There are many different kind of shells. Focus on Unix shells which you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.
A few shells dominating the space: **Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish** and many more!

All shells originate from the **Bourne Shell**, called `sh` created by Steve Bourne. **Bash means Bourne-again shell**.

If you use Mac, open your Mac terminal, by default it's running `zsh`. You can set up your system to run any kind of shell.

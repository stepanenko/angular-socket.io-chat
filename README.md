Linux powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It's the base upon which
everything is built upon. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.

The Linux "core" (called kernel) was born in 1991 in Finland.

There's one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft and Apple, or Google, will never be able to
offer: **the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer**.
There's no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project priorities.

There's not just "one Linux", instead, we have distributions.

A "distro" is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.
For example you have **Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu**, probably the most popular.

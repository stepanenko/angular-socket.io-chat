Learn in 20% of the time the 80% of core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time

Current reading: **The Linux Commands Handbook** by Flavio Copes

Linux powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It's the base upon which
everything is built upon. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.

The Linux "core" (called kernel) was born in 1991 in Finland.

There's one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft and Apple, or Google, will never be able to
offer: **the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer**.
There's no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project priorities.

There's not just "one Linux", instead, we have distributions.

A "distro" is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.
For example you have **Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu**, probably the most popular.

If you use a Mac you need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System, and it
shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.

> UNIX is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70's

The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I'll add into this repository.
